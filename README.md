- **Field Name Prefix:** trainingdml-ai
- **Scope:** Item, Collection
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions/README.md#extension-maturity):** Proposal
- **Owner**: @iwsql

This document explains the fields of The Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI)  Extension to the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (STAC) specification. Training data plays a fundamental role in Earth Observation (EO) Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning (AI/ML), especially Deep Learning (DL). The TrainingDML-AI Extension provides detailed metadata for formalizing the information model of geospatial machine learning training data. This includes but is not limited to the following aspects: 

路    How the training data is prepared, such as provenance or quality;

路    How to specify different metadata used for different ML tasks such as scene/object/pixel levels; 

路    How to differentiate the high-level training data information model and extended information models specific to various ML applications; 

路    How to introduce external classification schemes and flexible means for representing ground truth labeling.

#### trainingdml-ai:image_size

Size of the images used in the EO training dataset.  The imageSize  is recommended to be expressed in the form of "width\*height". If the imageSize of the training data in dataset is not the same, you can use the imageSize of Smallest size image and the imageSize of largest image to express, such as "minWidth\**minHeight~maxWidth*\*maxHeight".

Total number of labels in the  individual AI training sample.  

#### trainingdml-ai:quality  

Quality description of training datasets. Quality will be aligned with the DQ_DataQuality class in the ISO 19157:2013 spatial data quality model, and the quality assessment metrics for the sample dataset are described using the quality metric classes defined in ISO 19157:2013.

#### trainingdml-ai:data_sources  

Citation of data sources.  

#### trainingdml-ai:changeset

changed  training samples between two versions in the collection level. ChangeSet is used to locate updates to a specific version of a sample dataset by its identifier "datasetId" and version "version".

There are three types of updates for sample data units: "add" for adding new sample data units, "modify" for modifying existing sample data units, and "delete" for removing sample data units. "Modify" includes changes to metadata of sample data, changes to original data used in sample data, and additions, modifications, and deletions of all labeled objects in the sample data.

## Contributing

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the
[STAC specification contributing guide](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) Instructions
for running tests are copied here for convenience.

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid. 
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on 
your command line run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:
```bash
npm run format-examples
```
